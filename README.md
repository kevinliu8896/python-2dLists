# python-2dLists
practising 2d lists with python 
2dlistAssign1.py - searches for an number in a 2dlist and checks if list is filled with 0's(empty list)

2dlistAssign2.py - Simulating tetris to see if falling pieces collide. Falling pieces are represented as 1 and empty spaces are represented as a 0. If falling piece collides with another piece in place return true else false.

2dlistAssign3.py - using pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between trees that are randomly planted(1 represents a tree, 0 is an empty space) and a function check_distance is called to see if there are any trees planted within 3 meters if there is a tree must be planted somewhere else.
